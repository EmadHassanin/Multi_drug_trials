abstract = {OBJECTIVE Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a common epilepsy syndrome that is often poorly controlled by antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Comparative AED effectiveness studies in this condition are lacking. We report retention, efficacy, and tolerability in a cohort of patients with MTLE-HS. METHODS Clinical data were collected from a European database of patients with epilepsy. We estimated retention, 12-month seizure freedom, and adverse drug reaction (ADR) rates for the 10 most commonly used AEDs in patients with MTLE-HS. RESULTS Seven hundred sixty-seven patients with a total of 3,249 AED trials were included. The highest 12-month retention rates were observed with carbamazepine (85.9{\%}), valproate (85{\%}), and clobazam (79{\%}). Twelve-month seizure freedom rates varied from 1.2{\%} for gabapentin and vigabatrin to 11{\%} for carbamazepine. Response rates were highest for AEDs that were prescribed as initial treatment and lowest for AEDs that were used in a third or higher instance. ADRs were reported in 47.6{\%} of patients, with the highest rates observed with oxcarbazepine (35.7{\%}), topiramate (30.9{\%}), and pregabalin (27.4{\%}), and the lowest rates with clobazam (6.5{\%}), gabapentin (8.9{\%}), and lamotrigine (16.6{\%}). The most commonly reported ADRs were lethargy and drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo and ataxia, and blurred vision and diplopia. SIGNIFICANCE Our results did not demonstrate any clear advantage of newer versus older AEDs. Our results provide useful insights into AED retention, efficacy, and ADR rates in patients with MTLE-HS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To ascertain possible determinants of carbamazepine (CBZ)- and oxcarbazepine (OXC)-induced hyponatremia in a large cohort of people with epilepsy. METHODS We collected data on serum sodium levels in people with epilepsy who were attending a tertiary epilepsy center while on treatment with CBZ or OXC. We defined hyponatremia as Na+ ≤134 mEq/L and severe hyponatremia as Na+ ≤128 mEq/L. RESULTS We identified 1,782 people who had used CBZ (n = 1,424) or OXC (n = 358), of whom 50 were treated with both drugs. Data on sodium level measurements were available in 1,132 on CBZ and in 289 on OXC. Hyponatremia occurred in 26{\%} of those taking CBZ and 46{\%} of those taking OXC. This was severe in 7{\%} in the CBZ group and 22{\%} in the OXC group. Hyponatremia was symptomatic in 48{\%} and led to admissions in 3{\%}. Age over 40 years, high serum levels of CBZ and OXC, and concomitant use of other antiepileptic drugs were the main risk factors for hyponatremia in both treatment groups. Female patients on OXC were at a higher risk than male patients of hyponatremia. The risk of hyponatremia on CBZ was significantly associated with the risk of hyponatremia on OXC within a subgroup that used both drugs consecutively. SIGNIFICANCE Hyponatremia is a common problem in people taking CBZ or OXC. Regular ascertainment of sodium levels in those taking either drug is recommended and results should be acted on.},

@article{Fisher2017,
abstract = {Interspecific mutualisms, that is, reciprocally beneficial relationships between different species, are ubiquitous in nature and ecologically very important. The long-term stability of mutualisms, however, may be threatened by the emergence of 'cheaters' or by the abandoning or extinction of one of the mutualistic partners. Recently, we found large genetic variation in a key trait that helps to maintain the trophic mutualism between ants and aphids, whereby the aphids offer sugary-rich honeydew to the ants, which, in exchange, protect the aphids against natural enemies. In particular, we found that about half of all Aphis fabae black bean aphid clones screened do not invest in producing a key honeydew sugar, the trisaccharide melezitose, which also happens to be very attractive to and nutritionally valuable for ants. The aim of the present study was to find out whether ants have any mechanisms available to 'punish' such low-quality melezitose-deficient clones, for example by reducing their visit rate and level of protection against natural enemies. Surprisingly, we found that the visit rates of low-melezitose-secreting clone colonies were no different from those composed of normal, high-melezitose-secreting clones. Nevertheless, our results suggest that ants were more likely to collect honeydew from the high-melezitose-secreting clones. Overall, we conclude that the stability of this particular anteaphid mutualism is not maintained by active punishment and argue that this may be the reason why the low- melezitose-secreting clones manage to attain such high frequencies in natural populations.},

abstract = {The global introduction of 14 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) over the past 20 years as adjunctive treatment in refractory epilepsy has triggered an increased interest in optimising combination therapy. With a widening range of available mechanisms of AED action, much activity has been focused on the defining and refining "rational polytherapy" with AEDs that have differing pharmacological properties. This paper reviews the available animal and human data exploring this issue. The experimental and clinical evidence in support of "rational polytherapy" is sparse, with only the combination of sodium valproate with lamotrigine demonstrating synergism. Robust evidence to guide clinicians on how and when to combine AEDs is lacking and current practice recommendations are largely empirical. Practical guidance for the clinician is summarised and discussed in this review. In particular, care should be taken to avoid excessive drug load, which can be associated with decreased tolerability and, therefore, reduced likelihood of seizure freedom. A palliative strategy should be defined early for the more than 30{\%} of patients with refractory epilepsy. Nevertheless, the availability of an increasing number of pharmacologically distinct AEDs has produced a modest improvement in prognosis with combination therapy, which will encourage the clinician to persevere with continued pharmacological manipulation when other therapeutic options have been tried or are not appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2011 British Epilepsy Association.},

abstract = {The global introduction of 14 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) over the past 20 years as adjunctive treatment in refractory epilepsy has triggered an increased interest in optimising combination therapy. With a widening range of available mechanisms of AED action, much activity has been focused on the defining and refining "rational polytherapy" with AEDs that have differing pharmacological properties. This paper reviews the available animal and human data exploring this issue. The experimental and clinical evidence in support of "rational polytherapy" is sparse, with only the combination of sodium valproate with lamotrigine demonstrating synergism. Robust evidence to guide clinicians on how and when to combine AEDs is lacking and current practice recommendations are largely empirical. Practical guidance for the clinician is summarised and discussed in this review. In particular, care should be taken to avoid excessive drug load, which can be associated with decreased tolerability and, therefore, reduced likelihood of seizure freedom. A palliative strategy should be defined early for the more than 30{\%} of patients with refractory epilepsy. Nevertheless, the availability of an increasing number of pharmacologically distinct AEDs has produced a modest improvement in prognosis with combination therapy, which will encourage the clinician to persevere with continued pharmacological manipulation when other therapeutic options have been tried or are not appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2011 British Epilepsy Association.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare clinicians' choice of one of the standard epilepsy drug treatments (carbamazepine or valproate) versus appropriate comparator new drugs. DESIGN: A clinical trial comprising two arms, one comparing new drugs in carbamazepine and the other with valproate. SETTING: A multicentre study recruiting patients with epilepsy from hospital outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with an adequately documented history of two or more clinically definite unprovoked epileptic seizures within the last year for whom treatment with a single antiepileptic drug represented the best therapeutic option. INTERVENTIONS: Arm A was carbamazepine (CBZ) versus gabapentin (GBP) versus lamotrigine (LTG) versus oxcarbazepine (OXC) versus topiramate (TPM). Arm B valproate (VPS) versus LTG versus TPM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to treatment failure (withdrawal of the randomised drug for reasons of unacceptable adverse events or inadequate seizure control or a combination of the two) and time to achieve a 12-month remission of seizures. Time from randomisation to first seizure, 24-month remission of seizures, incidence of clinically important adverse events, quality of life (QoL) outcomes and health economic outcomes were also considered. RESULTS: Arm A recruited 1721 patients (88{\%} with symptomatic or cryptogenic partial epilepsy and 10{\%} with unclassified epilepsy). Arm B recruited 716 patients (63{\%} with idiopathic generalised epilepsy and 25{\%} with unclassified epilepsy). In Arm A LTG had the lowest incidence of treatment failure and was statistically superior to all drugs for this outcome with the exception of OXC. Some 12{\%} and 8{\%} fewer patients experienced treatment failure on LTG than CBZ, the standard drug, at 1 and 2 years after randomisation, respectively. The superiority of LTG over CBZ was due to its better tolerability but there is satisfactory evidence indicating that LTG is not clinically inferior to CBZ for measures of its efficacy. No consistent differences in QoL outcomes were found between treatment groups. Health economic analysis supported LTG being preferred to CBZ for both cost per seizure avoided and cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In Arm B for time to treatment failure, VPS, the standard drug, was preferred to both TPM and LTG, as it was the drug least likely to be associated with treatment failure for inadequate seizure control and was the preferred drug for time to achieving a 12-month remission. QoL assessments did not show any between-treatment differences. The health economic assessment supported the conclusion that VPS should remain the drug of first choice for idiopathic generalised or unclassified epilepsy, although there is a suggestion that TPM is a cost-effective alternative to VPS. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that LTG may be a clinical and cost-effective alternative to the existing standard drug treatment, CBZ, for patients diagnosed as having partial seizures. For patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy or difficult to classify epilepsy, VPS remains the clinically most effective drug, although TPM may be a cost-effective alternative for some patients. Three new antiepileptic drugs have recently been licensed in the UK for the treatment of epilepsy (levetiracetam, zonisamide and pregabalin), therefore these drugs should be compared in a similarly designed trial.},
